# RNN Implementation of Binary addition

## Contents
1. Generate sample data
2. Build Tensorflow RNN model
3. Train model
4. Calculator wrapper

Can be configured in 32, 16, and 8-bit modes however since the binary addition operation generalizes perfectly for each time step the bitwidth doesn't make much difference. For the same reason very few training examples are required to train the RNN.
Binary adder Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Implemented in Tensorflow in a Jupyter notebook.  RNN is also wrapped with a simple calculator so it is possible to manually test inputs.
